# safe-space

A project for the MU

## Installation

Clone this repo, navigate into the directory and run `npm i`,

In order to run the app, you'll need to have the Netlify CLI installed. You can do this globally on your machine by running `npm i -g netlify-cli`.

We then run `netlify dev` to start both the React server (on port 3000), the Functions server (on a random port), and the combined result on port 8888.
